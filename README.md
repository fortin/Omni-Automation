# Omni-Automation

A place for my Omni-Automation scripts, as I create them.

## Requirements

A Mac, iPad or other iOS device running Omni Group software, e.g., OmniFocus, OmniOutliner, OmniGraffle or OmniPlan. Be warned: many scripts are specific to and will work with a single application only.

## Installation

Copy the .omnijs or .omnifocusjs file to one of your linked OmniJS Plugins folder and run it from the Automation menu.
